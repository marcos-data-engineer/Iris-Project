# 🌼 Exploratory Analysis and Classification of the Iris Dataset 🌼

This project performs exploratory analysis and applies a decision tree algorithm to the famous Iris dataset. The goal is to better understand the relationships between the characteristics of the flowers and how to use AI to classify them.

## 📊 Project Steps

1. **Loading and Visualizing the Data**
   - Load the Iris dataset.
   - Visualize the first 5 rows.
   - Describe the basic statistics.

2. **Exploratory Analysis**
   - Create scatter plots to visualize relationships between the features.
   - Create histograms for each feature.
   - Present a correlation heatmap of the features.

3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Split the dataset into features (`X`) and target (`y`).
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.

4. **Training and Evaluating the Decision Tree**
   - Train a decision tree model.
   - Make predictions on the test set.
   - Calculate the model's accuracy and display the confusion matrix.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
